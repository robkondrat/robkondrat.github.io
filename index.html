<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I came from the world of software sales in the human capital industry, where I was inspired by developers progressing in their fields to change my own career course. 

  My creativity has traditionally been channeled through musicianship and illustration. Learning development made sense for both the creative side of my brain as well as the logical side. 

  As a software engineer, my goal is to leverage my coding skills gained in the classroom in combination with my ability to create memorable solutions.
